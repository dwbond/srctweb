On Contributing
---

SRCTweb welcomes all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel like you can be helpful the more technical aspects, we definitely need designers, technical writers, and testers.

There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing just a small spelling mistake.

If you need help at all please contact and SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn we are more than willing to help.

The project lead for this project is **Daniel Bond**. *dbond2@gmu.edu*

Please visit the [SRCT Wiki](http://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/) for more information on this and other SRCT projects, along with other helpful links and tutorials.

To get started, you'll need the following installed:
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Python 2.7.3](http://www.python.org/download/)
* [Pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/install.html)
* [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html#installation)

Open a terminal window and type in the following commands. (If you're on Windows, use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/). This will create a local, workable copy of the project.)

(set up pip and virtualenv)

``bash``
``git clone git@git.gmu.edu:srct/srctweb.git``
``cd srctweb/``
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
``cd srctweb/``
``python run.py``

To-do

Note-- this should also be on the wiki
* Links *everywhere*
* Consistent color scheming-- what on earth did Michel do to table formatting (and labels)
* The meeting page needs to have forms for the secretary to take notes, and pagination
* RSS feed for the meeting page
* Set up the documents with actual files
* Write Usage Policy
* Figure out intellectual property with GMU
* Some sort of a calendar plugin for the calendar page
* Add stuff to the events page-- same idea as meeting page, forms, pagination, and RSS
