# SRCTweb -- the homepage of Mason SRCT

Our own little site on the world wide web.

## On Contributing

SRCTweb welcomes all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel like you can be helpful the more technical aspects, we definitely need designers, technical writers, and testers.

There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing just a small spelling mistake.

If you need help at all please contact and SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn we are more than willing to help.

The project lead for this project is **Daniel Bond**. *dbond2@gmu.edu*

Please visit the [SRCT Wiki](http://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/) for more information on this and other SRCT projects, along with other helpful links and tutorials.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need the following installed:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

### Clone the srctweb codebase

Now, we're going to clone down a copy of the Go codebase from [git.gmu.edu](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/srctweb),
the SRCT code respository with SSH.

**a)** Configure your ssh keys by following the directions at:

[git.gmu.edu/help/ssh/README](https://git.gmu.edu/help/ssh/README).

**b)** Now, on your computer, navigate to the directory in which you want to download the project (ie. perhaps one called `~/development/SRCT`), and run

    git clone git@git.gmu.edu:srct/srctweb.git
