On Contributing
---

SRCTweb welcomes all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel like you can be helpful with the more technical aspects, we definitely need designers, technical writers, and testers.

There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing something as small as a spelling mistake.

If you need help, please contact a SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn, we are more than willing to help.

The project lead for this project is **Daniel Bond**. *dbond2@gmu.edu*

Please visit the [SRCT Wiki](http://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/) for more information on this and other SRCT projects, along with other helpful links and tutorials.
