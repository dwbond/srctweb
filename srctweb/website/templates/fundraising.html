        <p>
          For over half a decade, Student-Run Computing and Tech has provided software services, workshops, trainings, a forum for student and guest speakers, and much more for our members and for the George Mason University community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each year our program requires both the dedicated time committment of our students and substantial financial support to achieve. While we receive $5,000 annually through the Office of Student Involvement, our expenditures run double to triple this allocation.
        </p>

        <p>
          We work with other student organizations and academic departments to cover this shortfall, but also seek outside assistance to fully cover our costs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your generous donation can help us achieve our mission and continue to provide our services and host our events for another generation of Mason students. As thanks for your financial support, you will receive a wealth of meaningful benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
          We look forward to working together to bring your organization together with our talented student members.
        </p>
        <p>â€”</p>
        <p><strong>Jason Yeomans</strong>, President</p>

          If you are conducting an academic study, have employment or volunteering
          opportunities, or have developed a service you'd like to share, we will,
          at our discretion, give that information to students subscribed to a dedicated
          mailing list and Slack channel.
          We will also place promotional material together on a table at weekly meetings
          for students to review at their leisure.
