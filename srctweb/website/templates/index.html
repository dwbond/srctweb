<p><strong>S</strong>tudent-<strong>R</strong>un <strong>C</strong>omputing and
<strong>T</strong>echnology (SRCT, pronounced "<em>circuit</em>") is a student
organization at <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a> which
enhances student computing at our school by establishing  and maintaining systems
that provide specific services for Mason's community.</p>
<p>We were founded in 2011 to be a place where students could work together,
share their knowledge, and build really neat projects for the benefit of everyone
at Mason. See some of the ways we've improved life on campus on the <a href="{{ url_for('projects') }}">projects page</a>.</p>
