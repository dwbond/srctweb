    <p><strong>S</strong>tudent-<strong>R</strong>un <strong>C</strong>omputing and

    organization at <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a> which
    enhances student computing at our school by developing and maintaining systems
    that provide specific services for Mason's community.</p>
    <p>We were founded in 2011 to be a place where students could work together,
    share their knowledge, and build really neat projects for the benefit of everyone
    at Mason, as well as run a host of events to help get students involved. </p>

          There are a couple of opportunities to come and say hello. During the semester,
          we hold weekly meetings, where we run
          <a href="https://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/Category:Workshops">workshops</a>,
          work on projects, plan events, and handle administrative and organizational matters.
          Remember to bring your laptop!
        </p>
        <p>
          Development meetups are called to push forward work on projects or help students
          continue to build the skills they need to contribute. They're a little more sporadic,
          but you're always welcome to join in.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also come to any of our major events: all-day workshops, travel to conferences,
          hosting speakers, and more. Every event goes on our
          <a href="{{ url_for('projects') }}">calendar</a>, on our
          <a href="https://facebook.com/MasonSRCT">Facebook page</a>,
          and is announced on our

              Version control lets developers to save their progress at certain states, and then maintain a history of those saved points. It means you can fearlessly try out ideas and allows for multiple people to easily collaborate on the same project. Git is the popular version control program we use. All of our projects are on the git server we run for Mason, git.gmu.edu, and are mirrored to Github, a similar commercial service. Get a good handle on using git through <a href="https://try.github.io/">this quick tutorial</a>.

              Next, you can check out the source for our projects, and look at all of the issues we're working on. If you find any bugs, or think of a feature you think would be helpful, you can create an issue yourself. You can dive write in following each project's setup documentation, or work through a tutorial on some of the main development frameworks we use, Django (Python), or Meteor (JavaScript).
