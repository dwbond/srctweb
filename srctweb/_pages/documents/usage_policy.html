      <p>All users of SRCT systems must agree to George Mason's University's
      <a href="http://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/responsible-use-of-computing/">
      Responsible Use of Computing</a> Policy and abide by all other university
      <a href="http://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/">policies</a>. Usage is
      restricted to Mason affiliates.</p>

    <p>Systems are generally owned by the <a href="http://virginia.gov/">
    Commonwealth of Virginia</a>, and may be subject to additional policies
    and laws.  Services are provided best-effort, and users are not entitled
    to or guaranteed access. Access may be removed at any time, at the
    discretion of
    <a href="http://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/index.php/Systems_Administrator">
    Systems Administrator</a> and SRCT.</p>

    <p>In addition, individuals given advanced access to administer and manage SRCT
    systems or resources must agree to the
    <a href="https://www.usenix.org/lisa/system-administrators-code-ethics">
    System Administrator's Code of Ethics</a>, as defined by
    <a href="https://www.usenix.org/lisa">LISA</a>.</p>

    <legend>Handling abuse</legend>
    <p>Misuse of SRCT systems should be addressed by emailing the
    <a href="abuse@srct.gmu.edu">abuse team</a>.
    SRCT members will investigate the issue and take corrective action as
    deemed necessary. This may include disabling user access, taking down content,
    etc to ensure SRCT serves the educational goals of the University. Abuse
    reports may be forwarded to Mason's
    <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/resources/committee/srp/stopit.html">StopIt</a>
    team if appropriate.</p>

    <p>System administrators are the primary point of contact for urgent issues.</p>

    <legend>Handling service interruptions</legend>
    <p>SRCT will make an effort to let users know about known service interruptions
    ahead of time. In case of sudden outages, updates will be provided as soon as
    information is available and a full post-mortem will be posted. Mailing lists
    for this to be determined.</p>

    <legend>Responsible Disclosure Policy</legend>
    <p><i>Derived from Bugcrowd's Open Source Responsible Disclosure Framework</i></p>
    <p>We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.</p>
    <strong><p>Guidelines</p></strong>
    <p>We require that all researchers:
    <ul>
      <li>Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing;</li>
      <li>Perform research only within the scope set out below;</li>
      <li>Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us; and
      Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and SRCT until we’ve had 90 days to resolve the issue.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:
    <ul>
      <li>Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;</li>
      <li>Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission);</li>
      <li>Recognize your contribution on our Security Researcher Hall of Fame under "People" if you are the first to report the issue and we make an open code or configuration change based on the issue, and credit you throughout the open source process.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>In Scope:</b><p>
      <p><ul><li>Any deployed SRCT project listed on https://srct.gmu.edu/projects</li></ul></p>

    <p>
        Any services hosted by 3rd party providers and services are excluded from scope. These services include:
        <ul>
        <li>Google Analytics</li>
        <li>Any external CDNs</li>

        <li>Fabric (used for analytics)</li>
        <li>Other 3rd Party Services</li>
    </p>

    <p><b>In the interest of the safety of our users, staff, the Internet at large and you as a security researcher, the following test types are excluded from scope:</b></p>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating)</li>
    <li>Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing)</li>

    <li>UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes</li>
    <li>Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Any systems involved or attack types that would otherwise violate University Policies</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <p><i>Please note if there's anything such as UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes, you're more than welcome to contact SRCT anyways at exec@srct.gmu.edu where we will file a Gitlab issue, or go directly to the appropriate project at git.gmu.edu and, if you're a student with an active Patriot Pass, file the issue yourself.</i></p>

    <p>
    <b>Things we do not want to receive:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Personally identifiable information (PII)</li>

    <b><p>How to report a security vulnerability?</b></p>

    <ul>
