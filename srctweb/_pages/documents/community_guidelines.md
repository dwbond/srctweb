Our Pledge
---
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards
---
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a university setting.

Our Responsibilities
---
Project managers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project managers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Community Guidelines, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

Scope
---
This Community Guidelines apply to all members involved in the SRCT community, beyond that of the current developers.

Our Community Guidelines extend the Code of Student Conduct as instituted and enforced by Student Involvement and the Office of Student Conduct; they do not substitute or replace them.

Enforcement
---
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the executive board at srct@gmu.edu (or over Slack). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The executive board is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.


Community members who do not follow the Community Guidelines in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of SRCT’s developer body, to be voted upon with a two thirds vote, with a quorum (or more) of current developers, as defined in SRCT’s constitution.

Attribution
---
This Community Guidelines are adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html

Addendum
---
Attempt to avoid unrelated topics that derail project channels. Small tangents are fine, but if someone asks for discussion to be moved elsewhere then people should abide. 
1. Be respectful of speakers and try to avoid interrupting them excessively.
2. Try not to let low quality content or trolling take over a channel unless the channel is specifically designed for such content.
3. Avoid using inappropriate language in public channels.
4. Thread Slack conversations if possible.
5. Discuss politics in designated channels unless necessary or directly relevant.
6. Avoid usage of @everyone or @channel unless absolutely necessary, or if the channel is known to have many @channels.
7. Avoid repeatedly @ message (otherwise referred to as pinging) someone, especially if they’re unresponsive.
