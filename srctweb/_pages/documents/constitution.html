    <legend><a name="ArticleI" href="#ArticleI">Article I — Name of Organization</a></legend>
    
    <p>This student organization shall be named Student-Run Computing and techology (SRCT). The website for SRCT shall be located at <i>srct.gmu.edu.</i></p>
    
    <legend><a name="ArticleII" href="#ArticleII">Article II — Purpose of Organization</a></legend>
    
    <p>Student-Run Computing and techology (SRCT) will seek to enhance student computing at Mason. SRCT will focus on establishing and maintaining systems which would provide specific services to the general Mason community.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>

    <p>SRCT is strongly committed to the principles of Free and Open Source Software, and it is recommended that software used by or created by SRCT be Free and Open Source. However, we do acknowledge that there are times when proprietary software is more practical or more appropriate, and so our committment to open source shall not be considered an absolute requirement.</p>

    <legend><a name="ArticleIII" href="#ArticleIII">Article III — Membership</a></legend>
    
    <p>Membership in this organization will not be restricted on the basis of race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, gender identity, gender expression, sex, or age. Membership is open to all currently enrolled GMU students in good academic standing with the university with a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 who support the advancement of the organization’s principles. SRCT members will be classified as either <b>contributors</b> or <b>developers</b>. In this document, the term “general membership” shall refer to the combined body of contributors and developers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Contributors</strong></p>

    <p>Contributors are individuals interested in joining the SRCT community. All new members of SRCT are initially considered contributors. These members may not participate in official votes, nor will they have access to SRCT project management positions. They may contribute to SRCT projects under the guidance and supervision of a project manager.</p>

    <p><strong>Becoming a Developer</strong></p>

    <p>To attain developer status, a contributor must demonstrate leadership skills, commitment to SRCT principles, and technical ability. To become a developer, a contributor (hereafter referred to as “prospective developer”) should notify the Executive Board of their desire to become a developer and present a justification for gaining developer status. This justification should include a brief history of the prospective developer’s contributions to the organization. Alternatively, a developer may nominate a contributor to the Board and provide a similar rationale. The Board will review the rationale and vote on whether to admit the prospective developer. If the Board votes against admitting the developer, then the developer body (including the members of the Executive Board) shall be provided with the prospective developer’s rationale and will have their own chance to vote, conducted according to the rules of an official vote. If the developers vote to admit the prospective developer, they shall be admitted without prejudice. If the developers vote to not admit the prospective developer, then the prospective developer shall not be given developer status, but may re-apply in the future. No prospective developer may be voted on more than twice in one semester.</p>

    <p><strong>Developer Selection Criteria </strong></p>

    To be accepted as a developer, an individual must meet two of the following three criteria, with emphasis on the first two.
    <ul>
    <li>Active contributions to SRCT software projects.</li>
    <li>Active leadership participation in SRCT community events.</li>
    <li>Active social participation in the SRCT community, including meeting or event attendance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Developers</strong></p>
    
    <p>Developers are individuals invested in the SRCT community. These members have full voting rights and may request project management positions. A project management position entails access to SRCT infrastructure as required by their project, and as overseen by the System Administrator. Additionally, project management entails the responsibility to maintain project documentation and oversee project development. Developers may also contribute to SRCT projects under the guidance and supervision of the project manager. To attain developer status, a contributor must demonstrate leadership skills, commitment to SRCT principles, and technical ability. Prospective developers will be selected based on these qualifications by official vote. Any prospective developer will not be voted on more than twice per semester. Any developer who leaves the university, whether by graduating or otherwise, loses their developer status. Developers who graduate automatically become alumni members. Developers who leave the university without graduating do not automatically gain alumni status, but may request alumni status from the Executive Board, who will decide the matter by a majority vote. Developers who are expelled lose their developer status and may not request alumni status.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The following categories, <b>alumni members</b> and <b>honorary members</b>, are special categories of membership. The purpose of these categories is to allow non-GMU people to contribute to SRCT. Members of these categories shall be listed as members, but will not be counted in membership totals, and will not count as “Members” when this document refers to such.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Alumni Members</strong></p>
    <p>Alumni members are former developers or contributors who graduated from George Mason in good standing with SRCT. They may contribute to projects and offer advice, but they may not vote, hold leadership positions, or control SRCT resources.</p>


    <p><strong>Honorary Members</strong></p>
    <p>Honorary members are people who have been recognized for providing significant service, expertise, or other contributions to SRCT. They may be nominated by any contributor or developer and must be approved by a majority vote of the Executive Board. They may contribute to projects and offer advice, but may not vote, hold leadership positions, or control SRCT resources.</p>


    <p><strong>Revocation of Membership</strong></p>
    
    <p>In extraordinary circumstances, if a motion is brought and seconded at a meeting for membership revocation, all SRCT members will be notified by email of the motion not less than five days before the following meeting. If a quorum is present, an official vote will be held by secret ballot, requiring a 3/4 supermajority of present members.  Although an official vote, all present contributors will be allowed to present arguments for or against revocation of developer status prior to the vote.</p>
    <p>Developer status will be automatically removed if suspended or expelled by the university.</p>
