    <legend>Social Media</legend>
    <p>Social media account access will be delegated per a simple majority vote in the 
    executive board to any volunteering developer. Any executive officer has the ability 
    to revoke access to social media access for any developer.</p>

    <legend>General Amendments to this Policy</legend>
    <p>Amendments added here are those provided from a matter of precedent or executive decision.
    Policy added by executive decision should be made only to further regulate matters already 
    governed by the executive officers, or they should amend the <a href="/documents/constitution/">
    the constitution</a> as appropriate. Should a developer be in violation of these policies, members 
    should refer to the constitution for either removal of a developer or executive officer, whichever
    is appropriate given the context of the situation.</p>
