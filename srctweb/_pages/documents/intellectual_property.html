  <legend>Your intellectual property</legend>

  <p>Simply using our projects does not give you ownership of any of our intellectual property rights. However, because all of our code is available as <a href="software_freedom">free software</a>, you are more than welcome to contribute to our projects. Even if you aren't comfortable contributing code, ideas or a keen artistic eye are always in need.</p>
  
  <legend>Our intellectual property</legend>

  <p>We're working on licensing with the Office of techology Transfer, but until the details are ironed out, your contributions to SRCT projects fall under the same rules as <a href="http://catalog.gmu.edu/content.php?catoid=22&navoid=4772#STW">any other work you create</a> at GMU.</p>
