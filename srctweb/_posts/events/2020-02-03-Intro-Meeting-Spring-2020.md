Interested in SRCT? Want to learn more about us and meet our active members? If so, then this is the perfect place for you to get involved! Stop by JC Room 239A on February 2nd, 2020, at 6:00 PM for our Spring 2020 Intro Meeting. No technical experience is necessary - just a desire to eat pizza and talk to us!

SRCT President Zac Wood will be describing the organization on a more intimate level. He will be elaborating on our projects, planned events, and current state as an organization. Afterwards, there will be time for socializing! Pizza, drinks, and comradery will all be provided throughout the event!

Hope to see you there!
