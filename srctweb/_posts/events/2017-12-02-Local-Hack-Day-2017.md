Local Hack Day at Mason is a 12 hour hackathon organized by Student-Run Computing and Tech in conjunction with Major
League Hacking, together with hundreds of other schools around the world. Work in teams of two to four with students
from varying technical backgrounds and create something with hardware or software thatâ€™s beneficial and useful in a 
real-world scenario.

Sign in and breakfast will begin at 8:30 AM. Hacking is from 9 AM until 9 PM, with judging to occur afterward. We
encourage you and your hacking team to find somewhere comfortable to work throughout the day, but to be sure and
return for judging at the end.
